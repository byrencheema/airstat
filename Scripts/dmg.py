"""dmgbuild settings for the .dmg users download.

`hdiutil create -srcfolder` produces a working disk image, but it carries no window
settings, so Finder opens it as a plain list of two names and the drag is not obvious.
The layout below lives in the image's .DS_Store, which dmgbuild writes directly rather
than by scripting Finder, so this works with no Automation grant and no window on screen.

Coordinates are icon centres and must agree with Scripts/dmg-background.py, which draws
the arrow into the gap between them. Change one and re-run the other.
