/// macOS ships no public API for die temperatures or fan speeds. The two routes that
/// exist are `IOHIDEventSystemClient*` (private C symbols, resolvable only via `dlsym`)
/// and the `AppleSMC` user client. This collector uses the latter: `IOServiceOpen` and
/// `IOConnectCallStructMethod` are public IOKit, and only the request struct layout and
/// command codes are undocumented. That is a strictly smaller undocumented surface than
/// dlsym'ing private functions, and it fails closed — an unknown key or a changed struct
/// makes a read return a non-zero result byte, which is skipped, rather than crashing.
///
/// Both routes were measured on the target machine and agree; the SMC one additionally
/// exposes fans, which the HID route does not publish at all on Apple Silicon.
///
/// Nothing here is a cumulative counter, so `context.elapsed`, `isFirstSample` and
/// `didWakeFromSleep` carry no information for this collector — every reading is an
/// instantaneous gauge and there is nothing to re-baseline after a wake.
